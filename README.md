## To Do:

### Header

- Accord logo:
  - White bg shadow oval with blurred edges behind ACCORD logo.
- Fix width of backup bg image.
- Add the three call-to-action buttons.
  - (And their hover and click effects.)

### Nav

- Add mobile responsiveness.
- Add second layer below the first.
- Finally, adjust height so it rests at the bottom of the header when scrolled all the way up.

### Contact Section

#### Heading

- Stylize bg div.

#### Form

- Add "required".
- Adjust height of COMMENTS textarea based on media queries.
- SUBMIT button:
  - Add hover and click effects.
  - Adjust width based on media queries.
- Pop the entire form out toward you upon scrolling down.

### Evolution Section

#### Cards

- Cards are showing BEFORE the animation is triggered.

### Footer

- Continue refining widths of each column at different breakpoints.
- Add bounceInUp to each social media icon ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

## Notable Features

- The "Art of Evolution" cards change order inside their flexbox depending on screen width. This way, the image is on top when stacked vertically, but on the right when side-by-side.
