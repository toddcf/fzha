# 2018 Honda Accord

Sample landing page I built for the 2018 Honda Accord as part of a job interview. (Yes, I got the job!)

## To Do:

### Header

- fadeInRight each button ONE AT A TIME, after a delay. (DO NOT use Waypoints, as there is no need to trigger something on scroll that is at the top of the page.)

## Notable Features

- The "Art of Evolution" cards change order inside their flexbox depending on screen width. This way, the image is on top when stacked vertically, but on the right when side-by-side.
- Header height is adjusted to include nav at the bottom of the page no matter what viewport size.
- Header has a video background. If that doesn't load, there is a still image as a backup.
